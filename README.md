Hello World!
This is Shafi Sattar. I am a BS/MS Electrical Engineer from Drexel University. I work as a power electronics design engineer and have been looking to develop my programming skills as it would help me advance in my career. I am currently taking CS50 course on edx which has gotten me started on github. Looking forward to utilizing this tool and developing my programming skills.
